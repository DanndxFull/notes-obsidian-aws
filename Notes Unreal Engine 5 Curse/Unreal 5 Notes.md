To use a character that you put into a scene and avoid the start player default:
1. Open the blueprint of the character 
2. In details look for the word auto
3. in the Pawn Panel change Auto Possess Player to Player 0

It creates you a .cpp and a .h file
the .h file for the methods and variables
the .cpp file for the logic

After that to use this in unreal you have to run Terminal->Run build terminal task into the VS Code to build that file in unreal

Tick Method is like update method for unity, its called every frame

## Debugs In Unreal Engine

To make a debug.log as unity in unreal engine you have to write:

UE_LOG(LogTemp,Display,TEXT("Cosa Cosa"));

If you want to declare a string and use it in the debug:

Â FString MyString = "My String Value";
 UE_LOG(LogTemp,Display,TEXT("Cosa Cosa: %s"), *MyString);

To create and use functions in unreal  first declare it

Then use it with the name of the class like this

if our character can't go upward staris you can adapt the blueprint class of the player in the Walkable Floor Angle to walk in harder angles
